      - Together, you and your allies are able to block up the pipe. There are still
        some leaks, but you are confident that your team's work will disable the
        pipe for quite some time.
      - Hopefully the blockage will last long enough to give the river time to heal.
        In the meantime maybe you can gather enough allies to plug the pipe for good!
