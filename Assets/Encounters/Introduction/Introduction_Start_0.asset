      sentences:
      - It hadn't been the first time tales were told of the distant wasted lands...
      - But when the wretched waters reached our shores, when the skies began to
        darken with poisonous clouds, the tales became all too real.
      - 'With your friends sick and your family emaciated, you set off from your
        home into unknown and hostile lands. '
      - 'You carry with you the hopes and dreams of your people. To them you are
        a hero, the last hope to save your kind. '
      - The question is what kind of hero will you be?
